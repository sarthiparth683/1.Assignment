// Lecture Summary

// Enhancing UX with JavaScript: Infinite Scrolling, Modules, and Currying
// The lecture revolved around key JavaScript concepts to enhance user experience, including infinite scrolling, modules, currying, and the Document Object Model (DOM). Key points from the session include:

// Infinite Scrolling: Explained how to implement infinite scrolling using the scroll event listener and calculating the scrollbar's position to fetch and append additional content dynamically as users scroll down.

// Document Object Model (DOM): Discussed the fundamentals of the DOM, including element selection, creation, styling, and event listener addition for interactive web pages.

// Local Storage: Covered how to use local storage to store, retrieve, and remove data on the client side, enhancing the state management of web applications.

// JavaScript Execution: Detailed the execution of synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript code, including the event loop and how JavaScript handles operations like setTimeout and setInterval.

// Promises, Async/Await: Introduced promises for handling asynchronous operations, async/await syntax for writing cleaner asynchronous code, and error handling using try-catch blocks.

// APIs and HTTP Methods for CRUD Operations: Discussed interacting with APIs using the client-server model, performing CRUD operations using HTTP methods, and introduced JSON server for local development testing.

// Modules: Covered JavaScript modules, including the importance of import/export statements for code organization, reusability, and maintenance. Two types of exports were discussed: default and named exports.

// Currying: Introduced the concept of currying, transforming a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions each with a single argument, and its application in JavaScript.

// Practical Demonstration: Conducted a practical exercise by developing a simple CRUD application to illustrate the discussed concepts, particularly focusing on creating reusable components through modules.

// This session highlighted the practical applications of advanced JavaScript features to improve the structure, efficiency, and user experience of web applications.
