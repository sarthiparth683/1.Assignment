// Lecture Summary

// Lecture Recap: CAP-11 Doubt Session
// The CAP-11 Doubt Session served as an extensive guide on managing GitHub repositories, understanding the JSON server, and implementing CRUD operations in web development. Here are the key highlights from the session:

// GitHub Repository Management
// The lecture began with an explanation of how to organize and update GitHub repositories, emphasizing folder structure for assignments.
// Key Steps:
// Creating and naming folders correctly.
// Understanding the process of adding, committing, and pushing changes to GitHub.
// Understanding JSON Server
// The session transitioned into a detailed discussion on JSON Server:
// It's presented as a local database for development, mimicking a full REST API without coding.
// The importance of JSON Server for front-end developers looking to perform CRUD operations without a back-end was highlighted.
// Key Points:
// Installation and setup of JSON Server.
// Running JSON Server locally and using it to serve a mock API.
// CRUD Operations Implementation
// The core of the lecture was focused on implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations:
// Detailed code examples showed how to handle CRUD operations using JSON Server as the back-end.
// Examples:
// Fetching data (GET request).
// Adding new data (POST request).
// Updating existing data (PUT/PATCH requests).
// Deleting data (DELETE request).
// The discussion included handling form inputs and synchronizing them with the server data, along with error handling and response validation.
// Additional Insights
// Emphasis on the significance of understanding HTTP status codes and their role in CRUD operations.
// Guidance on how to manage node modules, .gitignore configurations, and the importance of readme documentation in GitHub repositories.
// Conclusion & Assignments
// The session concluded with a Q&A, addressing specific doubts about file management on GitHub, the functionality of JSON Server, and best practices for implementing CRUD operations.
// Assignments were given to reinforce the concepts discussed, focusing on practical implementations of CRUD operations and managing GitHub repositories effectively.
