// Client Server Model :
// The Client-Server Model is a fundamental concept in the realm of network computing.

// Imagine a restaurant again.

// The customer (you) is like the client.
// The kitchen where food gets prepared is like the server.
// When you (the client) get hungry, you ask the kitchen (the server) for food. The kitchen prepares the food and serves it to you. Similarly, in the digital world, a client (like your web browser) requests information or a service (like viewing a website), and a server provides that service.

// Detailed Breakdown:

// Client:
// A user device (could be a computer, phone, etc.).
// It requests services or resources.
// Examples: Web browsers, mobile apps, or any software that needs to access a service hosted elsewhere.
// Server:
// A device or system that provides services or resources to clients.
// Listens for requests from clients and serves them appropriately.
// Examples: Web servers, database servers, game servers.
// Communication:
// The client sends a request to the server (like asking for a webpage).
// The server processes the request, and sends back a response to the client (like sending the webpage content).
// This exchange typically occurs over a network, like the Internet.

// +------------+                          +------------------+
// |            |      Request (e.g.,      |                  |
// |   Browser  |  "Get me the homepage")  |  Web Server      |
// |            | -----------------------> |                  |
// |            |                          |                  |
// |            |     Response (e.g.,      |                  |
// |            |  "Here's the homepage")  |                  |
// |            | <----------------------- |                  |
// +------------+                          +------------------+

// Why is it important?

// The client-server model provides a way to distribute tasks or workloads. The client is responsible for the user interface and user experience, while the server manages the data and core processes. This separation allows for:

// Scalability: As more clients need service, you can upgrade or add more servers.
// Security: Sensitive data can be kept on the server side, shielded from clients.
// Maintenance: Updates can be made on the server side without affecting clients.
// Think of it as the backbone of how the modern Internet works. When you access a website, stream a video, or send an email, you're typically interacting within the client-server model.

// Use-case, Benefits, and Real-world Examples
// APIs in the Digital World:
// Use-case: Facilitate communication between different software components.
// Benefits: Enable modular and efficient software development.
// Real-world Examples: RESTful APIs, GraphQL APIs, etc.
// Fetch API in Action:
// Use-case: Fetching data from a server in a web application.
// Benefits: Asynchronous data retrieval without reloading the entire page.
// Real-world Examples: Updating user details, retrieving product information.
// Instructor Activity - Code Implementation
// API Basics:
// Explain the analogy with a restaurant to demystify the concept.
// Showcase basic API requests using tools like Postman.
// Fetch API Implementation:
// Walkthrough the Fetch API code snippet.
// Emphasize the importance of asynchronous handling.
// Student Activities
// API Exploration:
// Investigate different APIs available online.
// Experiment with making simple API requests.
// Fetch API Practice:
