// CAP-11-DOM Magic: Sorting, Filtering, and Pagination
// The lecture focused on implementing sorting, filtering, and pagination functionalities in web applications, primarily through manipulations in the DOM using JavaScript. Below are the summary and key points discussed:

// Overview
// The session began with a recap of previous lessons, emphasizing the importance of assignments. It highlighted the concepts learned so far, including asynchronous programming, try-catch blocks, APIs, query parameters, and restructuring APIs. The focus then shifted to sorting and filtering data retrieved from APIs and introducing pagination.

// Main Topics Covered
// JSON Server Utilization:

// An introduction to creating a mock server with JSON Server for backend simulation.
// Instructions on installing and starting the JSON server on a local machine.
// Emphasized the use of the JSON server for development and testing, not for production.
// Fetching Data from the API:

// Techniques to fetch data from an API using JavaScript.
// Explanation of the need for async functions and fetching data using await inside a try-catch block for error handling.
// Sorting Data:

// Demonstrated how to sort data (e.g., ascending and descending) fetched from an API.
// Covered the use of query parameters like _sort and _order to manipulate the sorting order.
// Filtering Data:

// Showed how to filter data based on certain criteria using query parameters.
// Illustrated using categories from fetched data to filter items and display specific results.
// Implementing Pagination:

// Detailed pagination to manage and display data efficiently across multiple pages.
// Discussed the use of _page and _limit as query parameters to control data visibility and manage the data load.
// Provided insights on dynamically creating pagination buttons based on the total data count and limit per page.
// Dynamic Pagination with Sorting and Filtering:

// Merged concepts of sorting and filtering with pagination, ensuring functionality works cohesively.
// Addressed dynamic adjustment of pagination based on sorted or filtered data.
// Specific Details
// Emphasized understanding API structure: baseUrl, path, and query parameters for effective API usage.
// Highlighted the importance of query parameters (_sort, _order, _page, and _limit) in modifying API responses.
// Instructions included creating and using a JSON server, dynamically manipulating the DOM to reflect fetched, sorted, and filtered data, and implementing pagination to improve user interaction with large datasets.
// This lecture essential bridged front-end techniques with backend-like functionalities, enhancing the attendees' understanding of creating more interactive and user-friendly web applications.
