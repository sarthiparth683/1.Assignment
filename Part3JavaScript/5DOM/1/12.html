      When we clicked on the child, technically we also clicked on the parent
      and grandparent as the child is inside them. This process of event
      handling, going from the child out to its ancestors is called event
      bubbling. When an event occurs on an element, it can propagate through the
      DOM tree in two phases: the capturing phase and the bubbling phase.
      Capturing Phase: During this phase, the event is captured from the root of
      the DOM tree down to the target element. Bubbling Phase: After the
      capturing phase, the event bubbles up from the target element back up to
      the root of the DOM tree. By default, event listeners are set to listen in
      the bubbling phase, meaning that the innermost element's event listener is
      executed first, and then the event bubbles up to the outer elements,
      triggering their event listeners in order. However, when you specify
      {capture: true} in an event listener, it changes the phase in which the
      event listener is triggered to the capturing phase. We can prevent further
      bubbling or capturing of events using e.stopPropagation() We can prevent
      further bubbling or capturing of events if there is more than one event
      present using e.stopImmediatePropagation() As a third argument of the
      event listener, we can pass {once: true}, to immediately remove the
      listener after the first event. .removeEventListener() can be used to
      remove a listener from an event.
