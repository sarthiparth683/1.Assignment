// Higher-order functions (HOFs) and callbacks are fundamental concepts in JavaScript programming. Understanding them is crucial as they enable developers to write more concise, efficient, and flexible code. Higher-order functions are functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them. Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to another function to be executed later. These concepts are essential for asynchronous programming, event handling, and functional programming paradigms.
