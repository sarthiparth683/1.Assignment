// Destructuring:
// Explain the concept of array and object destructuring in ES6. How does it simplify code compared to traditional variable assignment methods? Provide a scenario where destructuring can be particularly useful.

// Destructuring: â—¦ Destructuring is a feature in ES6 that allows you to extract values from arrays or properties from objects and assign them to variables in a concise way. It simplifies code by reducing the need for repetitive variable assignment. For example:
` Array destructuring
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const [x, y, z] = numbers; // x = 1, y = 2, z = 3

// Object destructuring
const person = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
const { name, age } = person; // name = 'John', age = 30`

























// Objects: Allows you to extract properties from objects into variables.  
// const person = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
// const { one, two } = person;
// console.log(two );

// Arrays: Extracts items from arrays.  
const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
const [asd,one, secondColor] = colors;
console.log(asd);

// Renaming: You can rename variables while destructuring.  
const { name: personName } = person;
