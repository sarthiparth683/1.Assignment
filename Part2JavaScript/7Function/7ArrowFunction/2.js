// Arrow Functions:
// Describe the difference between traditional function declarations and arrow functions in ES6. When would you prefer to use arrow functions over traditional functions, and vice versa? Provide examples to illustrate your answer.

// Arrow Functions: â—¦ Arrow functions are a concise way to write functions in JavaScript introduced in ES6. They provide a shorter syntax compared to traditional function expressions and do not bind their own this, arguments, super, or new.target. Arrow functions are particularly useful for inline functions, especially when using array methods like map, filter, and reduce. Here's an example:
` Traditional function declaration
function multiply(a, b) {
    return a * b;
}

// Arrow function equivalent
const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;`





















// Arrow functions provide a new way to write shorter function syntax.  
const add = (a, b) => a + b;

double = (x) => {
    return x * 2
}
//or
double = x => x * 2
//or
double
//is the same as

function double(x) {
    return x * 2
}
