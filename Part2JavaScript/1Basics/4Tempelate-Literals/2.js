// Template Literals: â—¦ Template literals, introduced in ES6, are strings that allow embedded expressions. They are enclosed by backticks (``) instead of single or double quotes and can contain placeholders (**${}**) for variable interpolation. Template literals support multiline strings and make string formatting more readable. For example:
const name1 = 'John';
let food = "cake";
let hobby = "football";
const greeting = `Hello, ${name1}, favrouit food=${food}, hobby=${hobby}`;
console.log(greeting);
