        Repository — In layman terms, this is analogous to a project folder that
        contains all your project files. Standard practice is to have one
        repository per project.
      </li>
      <li>
        Branch — Generally, developers use different branches for maintaining
        different modules of the project. Another common scenario that warrants
        the use of branches is when multiple members of the team want to work on
        the same piece of code. This is when each one can have its branch. By
        default, each newly created repository has a central branch named
        “master”.
      </li>
      <li>
        Clone — Cloning is like copying and pasting the repository from one
        drive(developer’s folder on GitHub) to another (our local folder).
      </li>
      <li>
        Stage & Commit — Creation of a new project version, on your git
        repository, is a 2 step process. The first step is to collect all the
        files which are required to be a part of the new version. This is called
        staging the files. The second step is to create the new version of your
        project which is called committing. Only those files which are staged,
        can be committed to a new version.
      </li>
      <li>
        Push & Pull — Given our focus on GitHub, push and pull is about
        interacting with repositories stored on GitHub’s cloud. A pull is like
        downloading the latest version and a push is synonymous to uploading
        your latest version on GitHub
